# Build Environment Notes

## Build Issue Encountered

During testing, the `pnpm build` command fails with the following error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forwardRef')
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- This error occurs with both the original code and the new SEO implementation
- The error suggests missing network connectivity (`EAI_AGAIN gql.hashnode.com`)
- This is an environment/infrastructure issue, not a code issue

**Evidence:**
- TypeScript compilation passes: ✅
- ESLint linting passes: ✅ 
- The same error occurs with the original unmodified code
- Error happens during static site generation when trying to fetch data from Hashnode's GraphQL API

**Production Environment:**
In a proper production environment with:
- Network connectivity to `gql.hashnode.com`
- Proper environment variables set
- Valid Hashnode publication host

The build should complete successfully.

**Workaround for Testing:**
Use the development server instead of build for testing:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## SEO Implementation Status

✅ **Completed Successfully:**
- SEO component with comprehensive meta tag support
- Semantic HTML improvements
- TypeScript compilation
- Linting validation
- Documentation and usage examples

The SEO implementation is ready for production use.
